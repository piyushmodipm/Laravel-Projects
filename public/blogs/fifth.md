# **JavaScript Frontend Speed is the Next Big Thing**

### february 2022

Faster and lighter web experiences are the next big things and teams of developers are reengineering their solutions to make them faster not only because speed metrics are being taken into consideration by search engines but because of the value of time for customers. Time is money is an adage that every one of us knows well and for the context of web development, more time for building and loading a web application is money spent by the web application owner and the customers.

Most of the optimization rooms are on the user side, the browser, where manipulating the DOM and rendering it faster has become a top-level priority that puts frontend engineering teams on a challenging time after they have built and chipped amazing user interface.

A large part of the slowness of web applications comes now from the loading of web pages due to the ever-growing number of third-party JavaScript externals scripts that make the UI interactive and easy to develop and that the browsers have to load and compile and execute. With minified, bundlers, code splitters, etc. we have significantly reduced the loading time of JavaScript and its execution by the browser but there are remaining rooms for improvement, and reimagining the design and architecture of frontend frameworks is one of these rooms.
