The first alpha release of Tailwind CSS v3.0 was released on October 1st. Let’s take a look at all the new features and improvements that Tailwind CSS V3.0 brings to the table. This article will be updated when more information is shared during the development.

New features coming to version 3.0
With every major Tailwind version there is a ton of new stuff to explore. Version 3 is no exception; it’s packed with new utilities, new variants and a major upgrade is coming to the Tailwind CSS CDN version.

Just-in-Time engine by default - AOT deprecated
With version 3.0 the Just-In-Time (JIT) engine is the new default engine for powering Tailwind CSS. The older Ahead of Time (AOT) mode is deprecated and can no longer be used in V3.

Guess now is a good time to start powering your current Tailwind 2.x projects by the JIT engine. This will make it a lot easier to upgrade your existing Tailwind 2.x projects to Tailwind 3.0 later this year when its officially released.
