# **A look at what is coming to Laravel 9**

### January 6th, 2022

Laravel v9 is the next major version of Laravel, and it was released February 8th, 2022. In this post, we wanted to outline all the new features and changes in this version.

Laravel 9 Release Date Changes
Laravel v9 was scheduled to be released around September of this year, but the Laravel Team decided to push this release back to February of 2022:

Laravel uses a variety of community-driven packages as well as nine Symfony components for a number of features within the framework. Symfony 6.0 is due for release in November. For that reason, we are choosing to delay the Laravel 9.0 release until 2022.
By delaying the release, we can upgrade our underlying Symfony components to Symfony 6.0 without being forced to wait until September 2022 to perform this upgrade. In addition, this better positions us for future releases as our yearly releases will always take place two months after Symfony's releases.

This will also push future major releases back as well, and here is the schedule going forward:

Laravel 9: February 8th, 2022
Laravel 10: February 7th, 2023
PHP 8 the minimum version in Laravel 9
Since Laravel 9 will require Symfony 6.0 and it has a minimum requirement of PHP 8 that means Laravel 9 will carry this same restriction.
