# **Why React Native is the next big thing?**

### Published on December 26, 2015

We've all heard the promise of cross-platform native apps driven by JavaScript. Titanium, PhoneGap, Ionic and other projects allow various levels of hooking in with the native environment, Trust me, I've wanted them to work with all my heart because of my lack of experience in native development. All of them fall short. Either you're just wrapping a web app or try to copy html & css, which fails to give the kind of performance you expect from a native app. I still found this hybrid app of Mallzee quite interesting. The app lags less, and has more or less the same features you expect in an app.

It only takes a few minutes playing with React Native to realize the potential it has. It feels like I'm developing for the web. But I'm writing a real native app, and you seriously can't tell the difference. Well, At least playing with the App does not make you realize that it's compiled with Javascript. The Best example I can find to prove my argument is the Facebook Groups App. I am finally back into my happy mood and finally can venture into Mobile App Development with the amazing piece of Engineering.
