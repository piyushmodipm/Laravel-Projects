Recently, we’ve discussed the advantages and disadvantages of both React and Angular. But there’s a third Colossus of Javascript frameworks that goes by the name of Vue. Where does this next big name come into play?

Vue has been growing rapidly and has continued to be one of the top 5 most popular starred JavaScript projects on GitHub since 2017. Basically, Vue.js is the perfect learning platform for those dipping their topes into JavaScript. The framework offers a flexible and high performing basis for any project, offering many tools, such as Vuex (management) and Vue Router options that offer advantages to quickly speed up software and app development. Regardless of the many features that Vue has to offer, the framework is one of the most lightweight to use, ensuring programs run smoothly while using less space overall, and integrates well with most existent applications.
